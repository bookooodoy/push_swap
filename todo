- Finish parsing errors checking
	Check that numbers exist X
	Check that there is no duplicate number X
	Check that integers are within integer range X
	
- Finish operations coding operations on the stacks
	Structure for push_swap (stack) X
	sa (swap a): Swap the first 2 elements at the top of stack a. X
	Do nothing if there is only one or no elements.
	sb (swap b): Swap the first 2 elements at the top of stack b. X
	Do nothing if there is only one or no elements.
	ss : sa and sb at the same time. X
	pa (push a): Take the first element at the top of b and put it at the top of a.
	Do nothing if b is empty. X
	pb (push b): Take the first element at the top of a and put it at the top of b.
	Do nothing if a is empty. X
	ra (rotate a): Shift up all elements of stack a by 1. X
	The first element becomes the last one.
	rb (rotate b): Shift up all elements of stack b by 1. X
	The first element becomes the last one.
	rr : ra and rb at the same time. X
	rra (reverse rotate a): Shift down all elements of stack a by 1. X
	The last element becomes the first one.
	rrb (reverse rotate b): Shift down all elements of stack b by 1. X
	The last element becomes the first one.
	rrr : rra and rrb at the same time X


// OPERATIONS
	- Initialize X
	- Pop X
	- Insert X
	- Swap X

- Fix tail and next() pointers (bad assignation) X

- Implement push_swap turk algorithm logic
